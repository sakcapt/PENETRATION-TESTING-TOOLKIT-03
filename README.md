#DESCRIPTION : This Python-based penetration testing toolkit is designed to perform basic security assessments, offering two main functionalities: a Port Scanner and an SSH Brute-Forcer. The Port Scanner identifies open ports on a specified target by attempting to establish connections, reporting any ports that are open. It uses threading to scan multiple ports concurrently, making it efficient for larger port ranges. The SSH Brute-Forcer attempts to gain access to a target system by systematically trying combinations of a provided username and a list of potential passwords. It leverages the paramiko library to handle SSH connections, with error handling for failed attempts and authentication issues. The toolkit's main menu provides a user-friendly interface, allowing users to choose their desired module, input necessary parameters (like target IP, ports, or credentials), and execute tasks seamlessly. This modular structure enables straightforward expansion for additional penetration testing features in the future.
